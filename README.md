# PhotoEditor
Brock McFarland and Shane O'Keefe

Brief Summary
1. This program loads image files, giving users the choice to edit the files by inverting them, adding a tint color, and changing the brightness. Edited photos can then be saved back to disk.

Known Bugs
2. Clicking on another directory while a directory's files are still loading causes the new 
directory's files not to load. 

Extra Credit
3. The image files are loaded into the listview as the background worker adds them into the image list.
